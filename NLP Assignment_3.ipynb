    "Answer- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network commonly used for sequential data processing, where the order of input elements matters. The basic architecture of an RNN cell, which forms the building block of an RNN, consists of three main components: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input Layer: The input layer of an RNN cell receives the input at a specific time step in the sequential data. Each element of the input sequence is represented as a feature vector or embedding. For example, in natural language processing tasks, each word in a sentence can be represented as a word embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hidden Layer: The hidden layer of an RNN cell captures and maintains information about the previous time steps in the sequence. It takes input from both the current time step and the previous hidden state. The hidden layer's purpose is to model the temporal dependencies and capture the context and history of the sequential data. It contains recurrent connections that allow information to be passed from one time step to the next. In the basic RNN cell, the hidden layer calculates the hidden state at the current time step by combining the input and the previous hidden state. This combination is typically achieved by applying a non-linear activation function, such as the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) or the rectified linear unit (ReLU), to a linear transformation of the input and the previous hidden state. The specific transformation is determined by learnable weights and biases within the RNN cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Output Layer: The output layer of an RNN cell takes the hidden state at the current time step and generates the output for that time step. The output can be used for various purposes, such as making predictions, classifying the input, or further processing in subsequent layers of the RNN or another network architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output layer can also have its own learnable weights and biases to transform the hidden state before generating the final output. The specific form of the output layer depends on the task at hand. For example, in language modeling, the output layer may be a softmax layer that predicts the probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next word in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic architecture of an RNN cell allows it to process sequential data by iteratively updating its hidden state and producing an output at each time step. This recursive behavior allows RNNs to capture long-term dependencies and handle inputs of variable lengths. However, basic RNNs can suffer from the vanishing or exploding gradient problem, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies. As a result, more advanced RNN variants, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), have been developed to address these issues and improve the modeling of sequential data."

    "\n",
    "In BPTT, the RNN is unrolled over the entire sequence for a fixed number of time steps. Each time step corresponds to a specific point in the sequence. This unrolling process creates a computational graph that resembles a feedforward neural network with connections across time steps."

    "Answer- The following is the difference between vanishing and Exploding gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient: The Gradient is nothing but a derivative of loss function with respect to the weights. It is used to updates the weights to minimize the loss function during the back propagation in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanishing Gradient: Vanishing Gradient occurs when the derivative or slope will get smaller and smaller as we go backward with every layer during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When weights update is very small or exponential small, the training time takes too much longer, and in the worst case, this may completely stop the neural network training.\n",
    "\n",
    "A vanishing Gradient problem occurs with the sigmoid and tanh activation function because the derivatives of the sigmoid and tanh activation functions are between 0 to 0.25 and 0â€“1. Therefore, the updated weight values are small, and the new weight values are very similar to the old weight values. This leads to Vanishing Gradient problem. We can avoid this problem using the ReLU activation function because the gradient is 0 for negatives and zero input, and 1 for positive input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploding gradient: Exploding gradient occurs when the derivatives or slope will get larger and larger as we go backward with every layer during backpropagation. This situation is the exact opposite of the vanishing gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem happens because of weights, not because of the activation function. Due to high weight values, the derivatives will also higher so that the new weight varies a lot to the older weight, and the gradient will never converge. So it may result in oscillating around minima and never come to a global minima point."
