    "Answer- Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models are a type of neural network architecture designed to process sequences of variable length and generate output sequences of variable length. They are commonly used for tasks involving sequential data, such as machine translation, text summarization, speech recognition, and conversational agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Seq2Seq model consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Encoder__: The encoder processes the input sequence and generates a fixed-length context vector or hidden state that captures the input's semantic information. It can be implemented using various types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The encoder reads the input sequence step-by-step, considering the order of the elements and accumulating information at each step to produce the context vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Decoder__: The decoder takes the context vector generated by the encoder and generates the output sequence step-by-step. Like the encoder, it can be implemented using RNNs. At each step, the decoder receives the previous output and the context vector as input and generates the next output element. This process is repeated until the entire output sequence is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seq2Seq models are trained using a teacher-forcing technique, where during training, the decoder is provided with the correct output sequence as input at each step. The model is optimized to minimize the difference between its generated output sequence and the target sequence."

The gradients carry information used in the RNN parameter update and when the gradient becomes smaller and smaller, the parameter updates become insignificant which means no real learning is done."

    "Answer- Gradient clipping is a technique used during training of neural networks, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to mitigate the issues caused by exploding gradients. It involves setting a threshold value for the gradient and rescaling it if its norm exceeds that threshold. The purpose of gradient clipping is to prevent the gradients from growing too large, which can lead to unstable training and hinder convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "When backpropagating through the network, the gradients computed at each time step are accumulated and can potentially become very large or small. If the gradients explode (i.e., their norm becomes extremely large), it can result in unstable updates to the model's parameters and cause training to diverge. Gradient clipping addresses this problem by enforcing a maximum limit on the gradient's norm."
